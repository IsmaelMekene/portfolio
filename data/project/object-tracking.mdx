This project aims to detect and track pedestrians (in motion or not) from a given videoshot in real time.
We created a real time object detector based on Retinanet (either YOLO) and Build a logical tracking system in the mean time. The implementation of this prototype has been based from transfer Learning with pretrained models on COCO Dataset.
