As part of my first project at Trimble, I have been working in an experienced research team and my role was to:

- Come up with new solutions in detecting of open spaces (Doors, Windows, etc.) into 3D point Cloud by using deep neural approaches.
- Integrate the prototypes into a complete software in order to ease it usage for the clients.
