This is a Computer Vision project aiming to create a Convolutional Universal Text Information Extractor from scratch. This is at the time a spatial and semantic segmentation project. The implementation of the model has been inspired from the original CUTIE paper to CVPR 2019 at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition subjects.
