As part of this internship, I have been working in an early stage startup environment, startup of Industrie 4.0 and my role was to:

- Built a Deep Learning Model Zoo aiming to solve several tasks such as Classifications, Segmentations, Object Detection, Forcasts and Bandits 
- Deployed models on embedded systems (mostly Raspberry Pi) into factories
